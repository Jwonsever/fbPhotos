# Tagged Facebook Photo Downloader
Developed on linux.

If you are on a different environment, or you are using a version of chrome other than 75, please replace the `chromedriver` in bin with the appropriate selenium chromedriver.  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 

To download all facebook tagged photos, run:
`java -jar main.jar`

It will ask for username / password, and then start scrping tagged photos.  It will take quite some time.
